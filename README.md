# ‚è∞ TickTockTokens
This project is an implementation of a *processor* that uses *Tick Tock Tokens* (TTT) for event-based computation.
TTTs have an expiry date and come in two flavors, *good* and *bad*, which can either trigger or interrupt/prevent a processor's generation of tokens.
If you put enough of these processors together, they can perform interesting computation.

The TickTockToken concept is a modification of Time-Petri-Nets that I came up with when trying to boil down event-based computing to its "atomic building blocks". I am using this concept in the context of simplified models of dendritic computation with spiking neurons, but it might be interesting for different applications, as well.
Your milage may vary.

## Uh ... wat?

Each TTT is an abstract "token", which is created by a processor when certain conditions are met, and then expires after a fixed amount of time. See the figure 1 below.

The lifetime of each token is tracked by a timer within the issuing processor, which begins counting down once a token is generated. When the timer runs out (or the token is otherwise terminated), I say that token has *expired*.

(Multiple) "entangled" copies of this token can be transmitted to (multiple) recipients, and each of these copies can be labeled as a *good* or a *bad* token. 
How many copies to send to from where to where, and whether to label each as *good* or *bad* is determined by the network *connectome*, which can be represented by a multi-directed-graph. 
Here, I'll treat the connectome as static for the entire simulation.

Each processor maintains counts of all good and all bad non-expired tokens it has received, which I'll call the *good* and the *bad live token count*, respectively.
The processor continuously monitors these two counts as new tokens come in or expire, and compares them against the respective *good* and *bad token threshold*.
While the bad token threshold is exceeded, the processor cannot generate any new tokens, and any already issued token(s) are *terminated*, i.e. they expire immediately.
If that is not the case and the good token threshold is exceeded, the processor will issue a new token (if it has capacity to do so; here, I'll assume a capacity of just one live token per processor, but this might change in future iterations)

When a new token is generated, this is communicated to all receiving processors by a *start* message; when the token ultimately expires (or is terminated), this is communicated by a second *stop* message.
These messages could be either sent via hard-wired connections, or via a packet-switched network-on-chip.

## How to use it
For simulation, run the enclosed scripts in the /simulations folder.
For running the hardware, I will add scripts in the /experiments folder once the hardware is tested.

## Acknowledgements
The original idea for this concept emerged from joint work with [Pascal Nieters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bl2wxiQAAAAJ&hl=en) on a simple [event-based model of neural computation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcogn.2023.1044216/full) that could be interesting for [a neuromorphic hardware implementation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3381755.3381763) and somewhat resembles an [extension of Time Petri Nets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517343.3517362).

I decided to implement this in an ASIC as part of TinyNeuromorphicTapeout (TNT) project following the Telluride 2023 workshop area on [open source neuromorphic tools](https://sites.google.com/view/telluride-2023/topic-areas/osn23-open-source-neuromorphic-hardware-software-and-wetware).
Thanks to [Jason Eshraghian](https://www.jasoneshraghian.com/) and [Peng Zhou](https://pengzhou.sites.ucsc.edu/) for pushing and organizing the TNT project, and thanks to [ReJ](https://github.com/rejunity/) for helpful discussions!
The TNT project in turn is based on [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com), so I tip my hat to [Matt Venn](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn) and the TinyTapeout community for their efforts to democratize VLSI design!
